/-- A look-ahead sequence (Equation 14) of a given trace of forward permutation queries, and an
  initial state, consists of:
- A list of input states
- A list of output states

subject to the following conditions:
- The two list of states have the same length
- The first input state is the given initial state
  ...

  queries, an initial state, and a challenge round index `i`, is defined as a finite set of

/-- The lookahead procedure in Section 5.2, which takes in:
- A query-answer trace for the oracle `p`
- A permutation state (vector of `N` units)
- A round index `i` for a challenge round

Then performs a probabilistic computation (allowing to sample units uniformly at random) returning
one of the following:
- `none`
- `err`
- An encoded verifier's challenge (vector of `chalSize i` units)

TODO: figure out the best way to encode the two errors (currently we encode `err` as the failure of
OracleComp, and `none` as `Option.none` inside)

  /- Actual algorithm:
  1. Compute the lookahead sequence family `𝒮_LA` from the forward permutation trace `tr.p`
  2. If `𝒮_LA` is empty, return `none`
  3. If `𝒮_LA` has more than one element, return `err`
  4. Let `S_LA` be the unique element of `𝒮_LA`.
  Sample random rate segments
  `vec_s : Fin (pSpec.Lᵥi i - S_LA.inputState.length) → Vector U SpongeSize.R`, and return
  `ρᵢ = (S_LA.inputState.map (fun s => s.rateSegment) ++ vec_s).take (challengeSize i)`
  i.e. concatenate the rate segment of the input states of `S_LA` with `vec_s`, and take the first
  `challengeSize i` elements (since we might be over-sampling)
