/-- A backtracking sequence (Definition 5.3) for a given hash-duplex-sponge oracle trace `tr` and
  final duplex-sponge state `s` consists of the following data:
- An input statement `𝕩`
- A list `inputState = [sᵢₙ, ...]` of input states
- A list `outputState = [sₒᵤₜ, ...]` of output states

subject to the following conditions:
- The last of the input states is the given final state
- There is one more input state than output state
- The statement is queried with the hash, and returns the capacity of the first input state
  `(hash, 𝕩, inputState[0].capacitySegment) ∈ tr` -/

/-- The backtracking procedure in Section 5.2, which takes in:
- the query-answer trace for the oracle `(h, p, p⁻¹)`
- a state (vector of `N` units)

And returns one of the following:
- `none`
- `err`
- A result consisting of: an input statement, a round index `i ≤ n`, and the protocol messages up to
  round `i`

NOTE: we do _not_ define the extra data structure `tr▵` as in the paper, as that is entirely derived
from the actual trace and is only present for efficiency (which we do not plan to reason about)

TODO: figure out the best way to encode the two errors (currently we encode `err` as the failure of
OracleComp, and `none` as `Option.none` inside) -/
