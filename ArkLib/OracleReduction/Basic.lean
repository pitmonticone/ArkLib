# Interactive (Oracle) Reductions

This file defines the basic components of a public-coin **Interactive Oracle Reduction** (IOR).
These are interactive protocols between two parties, a prover and a verifier, with the following
format:

  - The protocol proceeds over a number of steps. In each step, either the prover or the verifier
    sends a message to the other. We assume that this sequence of interactions is fixed in advance,
    and is described by a protocol specification (see `ProtocolSpec.lean`).

    Note that we do _not_ require interleaving prover's messages with verifier's challenges, for
    maximum flexibility in defining reductions.

  - Both parties may have access to some shared oracle, which is modeled as an oracle specification
    `OracleSpec`. These are often probabilistic sampling or random oracles.

  - At the beginning, the prover and verifier both take in an input statement `StmtIn`. There are a
    number of input **oracle** statements `OStmtIn` whose underlying content is known to the prover,
    but is only available via an oracle interface to the verifier. The prover also takes in a
    private witness `WitIn`.

  - During the interaction, the verifier is assumed to always send uniformly random challenges to
    the prover. The prover will send messages, which is either available in full to the verifier, or
    received as oracles. Which is which is specified by the protocol specification.

  - At the end of the interaction, the verifier performs a computation that outputs a new statement
    `StmtOut`, and specify a _subset_ of the oracles it has received to be the output oracle
    statements.

Our formulation of IORs can be seen in the literature as **F-IORs**, where `F` denotes an arbitrary
class of oracles. See the blueprint for more details about our modeling choices.

We can then specialize our definition to obtain specific instantiations in the literature:

  - **Interactive Reductions** (IRs) are a special kind of IORs where _all_ of the prover's messages
    are available in full.
  - **Interactive Oracle Proofs** (IOPs) are a special kind of IORs where the output statement is
    Boolean (i.e. `accept/reject`), there is no oracle output statements, and the output witness is
    trivial.
  - Further specialization of IOPs include **Vector IOPs**, **Polynomial IOPs**, and so on, are
    defined in downstream files. Note that vector IOPs is the original definition of IOPs [BCS16],
    while polynomial IOPs were later introduced in [BCG+19] and others.
  - **Interactive Proofs** (IPs) are a combination of IRs and IOPs.
  - **Non-Interactive Reductions** (for example, folding or accumulation schemes) are IRs with a
    single message from the prover.
  - **Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge** (NARKs) are IPs with a single message from the
    prover.

We note that this file only defines the type signature of IORs. The semantics of executing an IOR
can be found in `Execution.lean`, while the security notions are found in the `Security` folder.

Note the appearance of the various dependencies in the type signatures:
- `oSpec : OracleSpec ι` comes first, as we expect this to be the ambient (fixed) shared oracle
  specification for the protocol
- `StmtIn` comes next, as the type of the input statement to the protocol
- Then we have `OStmtIn` for the type of the oracle input statements (for oracle reductions),
  followed by `WitIn`, the type of the input witness
- Then we have `StmtOut` for the type of the output statement, followed by `OStmtOut` for the type
  of the output oracle statements, and finally `WitOut` for the type of the output witness
- Finally, we have `pSpec : ProtocolSpec n`, which is the protocol specification for the (oracle)
  reduction

We arrange things in this way for potential future extensions, where later types may depend on
earlier types (i.e. `WitIn`, `StmtOut`, or `pSpec` may depend on `StmtIn`; though we do not expect,
say, `StmtOut` or `pSpec` to depend on the witness types, as that is not available to the (oracle)
verifier).

Sketch of the upcoming refactor to the prover's type (dependent on VCVio refactor):

Consider the prover's type in a sigma protocol, denoted using an iterated monad:

`CtxIn → m (Message × m (Challenge → m (Response × m (CtxOut))))`

where `m = OracleComp oSpec` for some `oSpec : OracleSpec`.

How do we translate these into a stateful representation?

Recall:

- `input : CtxIn → PrvState 0`

- `sendMessage 0 : PrvState 0 → m (Message × PrvState 1)`

- `receiveChallenge 1 : PrvState 1 → m (Challenge → PrvState 2)`

- `sendMessage 2 : PrvState 2 → m (Response × PrvState 3)`

- `output : PrvState 3 → m (CtxOut)`

What are `PrvState {0, 1, 2, 3}`?

- `PrvState 0 = m (Message × m (Challenge → m (Response × m (CtxOut))))`

- `PrvState 1 = m (Challenge → m (Response × m (CtxOut)))`

- `PrvState 2 = m (Response × m (CtxOut))`

- `PrvState 3 = m (CtxOut)`

All maps (except `input`) are then identity!

/-- The type signature for the prover's state at each round.

state before the first message and the last state after the last message. -/

  init : PrvState

/-- Represents the interaction of a prover for a given protocol specification.

In each step, the prover gets access to the current state, then depending on the direction of the
step, the prover either sends a message or receives a challenge, and updates its state accordingly.

For maximum simplicity, we only define the `sendMessage` function as an oracle computation. All
other functions are pure. We may revisit this decision in the future.

/-- The output function of the prover, which takes in the prover's final state and returns an oracle
    computation that outputs some specified output type `Output`

  We note that an honest prover may output both the output statement and witness (for easier
  composability), but an adversarial prover in the knowledge soundness game may only output the
  witness.

  output : PrvState → OracleComp oSpec Output

/-- The type of algorithms that participates in an (interactive) reduction in the role of the
  prover. This consists of:

- `PrvState 0, ..., PrvState n`: the types for the private state, from before the first message to
  after the last message
- `init : PrvState 0` is the initial state
- `sendMessage` and `receiveChallenge` are the functions for sending and receiving messages for each
  round, depending on the direction of the round.

This is useful when modeling soundness, since we do not want to mandate that adversarial provers in
the soundness game need to input or output anything. -/

  that outputs the output type `Output`

This is useful when modeling knowledge soundness, since we do not want to mandate that adversarial
provers in the knowledge soundness game need to input the input statement or witness. We also do not
need the adversarial prover to output any output statement, as such values are sourced from the
verifier.

/-- The type of honest provers for an interactive reduction with `n` messages. This consists of:

  - `PrvState 0`, ..., `PrvState n` are the types for the prover's state at each round
  - `input` initializes the prover's state by taking in the input statement and witness
  - `sendMessage` takes in the prover's state, then returns an oracle computation that outputs a
    message and the next prover's state
  - `receiveChallenge` takes in the prover's state, then returns an oracle computation that outputs
    a function that takes in a challenge and returns the next prover's state
  - `output` returns the output statement and witness from the prover's state

Note that the output statement by the prover is present only to facilitate composing honest provers
together. For completeness, we will require that the prover's output statement is always equal to
the verifier's output statement. For soundness and knowledge soundness, we will use more restricted
types of provers (see `ProverInteraction` and `ProverInteractionWithOutput`). -/

Problem with current prover definition: it's too "rigid" for (knowledge) soundness, to the point
where it's difficult (impossible?) to prove that knowledge soundness implies soundness.

The problem is that any prover (even adversarial) is assumed to have an input & output functions.
This does not really need to be the case. For knowledge soundness, we do not need any input, and
for soundness, we don't even need the output. All we care about that the prover participates in the
interaction to produce a transcript.

TODO: see if the new `ProverInteraction` and `ProverInteractionWithOutput` types can be used to
prove knowledge soundness implies soundness.

    ιₛᵢ ⊕ pSpec.MessageIdx` and a proof that `OStmtOut` is compatible with `OStmtIn` and
    `pSpec.Messages` via this embedding.

other than specifying a subset of the ones it has received (and dropping the rest). -/

  the output statement, but not on the list of queries made to the oracle statements or the prover's
