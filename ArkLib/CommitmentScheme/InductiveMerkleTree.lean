# Inductive Merkle Trees

This file implements Merkle Trees. In contrast to the other Merkle tree implementation in
`ArkLib.CommitmentScheme.MerkleTree`, this one is defined inductively.

## Implementation Notes

This works with trees that are indexed inductive binary trees,
(i.e. indexed in that their definitions and methods carry parameters regarding their structure)
as defined in `ArkLib.Data.IndexedBinaryTree`.

* We found that the inductive definition seems likely to be convenient for a few reasons:
  * It allows us to handle non-perfect trees.
  * It can allow us to use trees of arbitrary structure in the extractor.
* I considered the indexed type useful because the completeness theorem and extractibility theorems
  take indices or sets of indices as parameters,
  and because we are working with trees of arbitrary structure,
  this lets us avoid having to check that these indices are valid.

## Plan/TODOs

- [x] Basic Merkle tree API
  - [x] `buildMerkleTree`
  - [x] `generateProof`
  - [x] `getPutativeRoot`
  - [x] `verifyProof`
- [x] Completeness theorem
- [ ] Collision Lemma (See SNARGs book 18.3)
  - (this is really not a lemma about oracles, so it could go with the binary tree API)
- [ ] Extractibility (See SNARGs book 18.5)
- [ ] Multi-leaf proofs
- [ ] Arbirary arity trees
- [ ] Multi-instance

Completeness theorem for Merkle trees.

The proof proceeds by reducing to the functional completeness theorem by a theorem about
the OracleComp monad,
and then applying the functional version of the completeness theorem.
