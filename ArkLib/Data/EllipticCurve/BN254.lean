# BN254 Elliptic Curve

WARNING: this is experimental. Use with caution!

This file defines the BN254 elliptic curve, a pairing-friendly curve used in
cryptographic applications.

The BN254 curve is defined over a prime field with the equation Y² = X³ + 3.

## Main definitions

* `BN254.baseFieldSize`: The characteristic of the base field
* `BN254.BaseField`: The base field F_p where the curve is defined
* `BN254.curve`: The BN254 elliptic curve as a Weierstrass curve
* `BN254.generator`: A generator point on the curve

## References

The BN254 curve parameters follow the specification used in Ethereum's alt_bn128
precompiles and various zero-knowledge proof systems.
