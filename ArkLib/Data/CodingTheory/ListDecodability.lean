/-- The set of `r`-close codewords to a given word `y` with respect to the relative Hamming
distance.
Note that this is exactly `Λ (C, y, r)` from [ACFY24] and ` List (C, y, r)` from [ACFY24stir]. -/

/-- A code `C` is `(r,ℓ)`-list decodable.

- Remark:
   Note that the number of codewords `ℓ` in the Hamming ball of radius `r`
   centred around `y` is a real number. The reasoning for this is to accommodate the statement of
   the Johnson Bound Theorem. For simplicity and ease of proving statements, `ℓ` can be considered a
   a natural number by taking the floor of the real value. This will not lead to information loss
   since the cardinality of the set of close codewords is a natural number anyway. -/

/-- A code `C` is uniquely decodable up to a relative distance `r` if for any word `y : ι → F`,
there is at most one codeword in `C` within a relative Hamming distance of `r`.
This is a special case of list decodability where the list size `ℓ` is `1`. -/
